## Description

This is a simple Dart program that checks whether the numbers in a list are even or odd. It uses a switch statement to determine the parity of each number and prints the result to the console.

## How It Works

A list of numbers is defined in the program.
The program loops through each number in the list.
For each number:

- The switch statement checks the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
- If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
- If the remainder is 1, the number is odd.

- The result is printed to the console.
  Code Structure
- List Creation: A predefined list of integers.
- Loop: Iterates through each element of the list.
- Switch Case:
- Case 0: Handles even numbers.
- Case 1: Handles odd numbers.

## Usage

Copy and paste the code into a Dart environment
Run the program to see the output in the console.
