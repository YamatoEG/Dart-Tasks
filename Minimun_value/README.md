## 📚 Find Minimum Value in a List of integer numbers

---

This Dart program finds the minimum value in a list of integers using a custom function.

---

# 🚀 Description

- The program defines a list of integers.
- The findMin function iterates through the list to identify and return the smallest number.

# 🛠️ How It Works

- The first element of the list is assigned as the initial minimum (smol).
- A for loop compares each element with smol.
- If a smaller value is found, smol is updated.
- The function returns the final minimum value.
